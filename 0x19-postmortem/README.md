#POSTMORTEM WRITTEN BY MARTINS EZEH. 

At the start of my ALX journey have experienced a lot of Outage, which so many occurred when i was trying to open my github and also my Web terminal for coding, which led to me destroying my sandbox multiple times, where  as the solution was just for me to use an external software for coding and adding my Personal access token to the terminal.


This outage lasted for atleast 72 hours, started at Jan 3 to Jan 6th.

I was the only one affected cause its a single project for one person, and i experienced delay in completing my tasks, and also problems in pushing my codes.

The root cause was due to the fact that am using a mobile phone which is not updated, so the coding is giving it issues to catch up.

On the 1st day of January 2023 this issue was detected. 

I noticed it myself because many of my mates are pushing successfully but am finding it difficult to.

The terminal was slow on my mobile so an external software helped me solve the issue.

My network and terminal was investigated, at first the misleading investigation was destroying my terminal multiple times,  also trying to install external packages on my Web terminal. 

I shared this issues with my entire shell code community,  the programing head of our group Miracle, was able to dictate the issue.
She then did a video call with me, and i shared my screen, so she advised me to get Termux and also copy out my PAT and link it to my server on the terminal.


ROOT CAUSE.

The issues was caused not just by one  problem,  my mobile required update, my coding requires another app to function well, also my PAT was not correctly inputted that's the cause of the code pushing errors.

So i updated my phone, downloaded the required app needed to run this code successfully and then added my PAT to fix all errors am having.

Things That's can be improved are making the terminal easily accessible by mobiles, combining PAT together when creating repositories in order to help make the process very easy.
Configure Termux with the main Web terminal and Build a platform where all issues experienced are stated with solutions.
